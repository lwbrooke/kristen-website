<h1 class="title">Welcome to {{siteName}}!</h1>
<p>I am a writer and editor with 3 years of web content experience. I have a degree in English with a Creative Writing Emphasis and an Editing Certificate from the University of Washington. I am creative and passionate about writing and editing, and I have a keen eye for detail regarding content. In the past I have participated in a wide range of roles involving various mediums of content, including managing and editing web content, collaborating with others on social media, managing and producing SEO-friendly content, and writing and editing individual pieces that have been featured in student collections, professional blogs, websites, and magazines.</p>

<p>I hope to expand my passion beyond my personal blog and bullet journal and be a full-time writer and/or editor for a media company or website. My personal passions include but are not limited to: history podcasts, advocacy and global development, young adult literature, sci-fi anything, and cats.</p>
